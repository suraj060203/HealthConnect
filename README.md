# Health-Connect
Project developed by HackAlt Team. 
# Overview 
# Problem statement  : 
1. Hospital full management system : In hospital there are many issues to manage the data of patient and other respective things parallely . Also , there are many models is there in which management work can be done but theyre not useful as they not providing the integrated system / software for nurses , doctor , admin works in an integrated / interlink connection . also , needs high costing also to maintain that data .
2. Cancer predicition - predicting the cancer in early stages got high work for many health care departments as accuarcy cant be matched .
3. Heart disease prediction - predicting the heart disease in early stages and its particular variant is a lengthy thus , not so accurate process for healthcare and research departments .


# What is Health Connect ? 

Health-Connect is a comprehensive hospital website with many features such as management system developed by the Vytotech Team to address data management challenges and streamline healthcare operations. The system integrates nurse, doctor, and admin workflows, providing interconnected access to patient records, appointments, and hospital resources. Additionally, the project includes machine learning models for cancer and heart disease prediction with high accuracy, allowing for early detection and improved patient care. By centralizing data and automating processes, Health-Connect enhances hospital efficiency and supports better patient outcomes.

# Solution : 

1. Created a full responsive website in which a one can access the website in its particular section and the respectives are nurse , doctor , admin in which each section data are interlinked with each another resolving the data management problem . Also , in nurse section the features are one can book an appointment with the doctor of patient and can view the beds alloted information . In doctor section the one can add the patient report can view it and also can directly book the appointment with patient . Then in admin section the one can add the new nurse ,new doctor , can give the acess to new admin and can add the ambulance records and also the beds avalibility .

The data is fully interlinked and stored in perfect schema 
And it is a fully fletch management section ordering . 

2. Pre Cancer prediction : We have created the cancer prediction model in which we used machine learning algorithms to check the accuracy of the data set of respective persons using the .csv input models . Also , the accuracy of this model is 98 percent since this is a inital verification model so we will add the user input in future scopes also , a petient reports input can be inputted in csv file and as per that the predictions and accuracy can be modelled . the prrofs are thus attached in the file as well and the section integration done in the website also .

   3. Heart disease prediction : We have also created the heart disease prediction model verification in which there are several data inputs by checking and cross comparing that the one can verify the heart disease type and its accuracy . This is a learned model using machine learning algorithms and we have integrated this model in our website so the hospital can view the verification of that data sets and can proof the heart disease early symptoms of the patient according to the .csv file !!
  
4. We have the contact / query form in which one patient can ask and book the doctor appointment in reference to the administrator and admin will provide the details in accordance to the patient desirability .
